# Title: Counting Strings Exercise

# Problem Statement:
# You are given two strings, A and B. Your task is to count how many strings equal to A can be constructed using letters from the string B. 
# Each letter can be used only once and in one string only.

# Example:
# Let's take an example to understand the problem better:
# A = "abc"
# B = "abccba"


# Task:
# Your task is to write a Python function that takes in two strings, A and B, and returns the count of strings equal to A that can be constructed using letters from B.



# Input:

# A: A string containing lowercase letters. (3 ≤ A.length ≤ 9)
# B: A string containing lowercase letters. (3 ≤ B.length ≤ 50)
# Output:

# An integer representing the count of strings equal to A that can be constructed using letters from B.
